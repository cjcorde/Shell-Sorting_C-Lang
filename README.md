# Shell-Sorting_C-Lang
This repository contains an implementation of the Shell Sort algorithm in C. Shell Sort is an efficient sorting algorithm that is an extension of the Insertion Sort. It works by sorting elements that are distant from each other and progressively reduces the interval between elements until the entire array is sorted.
